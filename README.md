##  Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cubeaamir/EV-Trend-Data-Analysis-Project.git
   cd EV-Trend-Data-Analysis-Project
````

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies** (if a `requirements.txt` is added):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Open and run the notebook**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook EV_Analysis.ipynb
   ```

## Insights & Findings

**You can refine this section based on your actual results.**

Examples of possible insights:

* EV sales have grown at an **X% compound annual rate** since YEAR.
* There’s a clear correlation between **battery capacity improvements** and cost reductions.
* The number of **charging stations** per region has grown **Y-fold**, especially in COUNTRY.
* Geographic heatmaps reveal emerging **EV adoption hotspots**, such as REGION.

---

## Future Enhancements

* Integrate **more datasets** (e.g., pricing, consumer preference, policy incentives).
* Add **interactive dashboards** using Plotly Dash or Streamlit.
* Compare EV trends globally vs regionally side-by-side.
* Forecast future trends using **time-series modeling** (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet).
